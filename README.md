# Transcriber
This code sends audio URLs to the [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs) API and receives transcribed text.

## Audio URL
Make sure that audio_url value automatically triggers the download of the audio file. You can test if the audio file can be downloaded by pasting the URL for your audio file directly into the browser's URL bar. If the file downloads rather than displaying a webpage, that should work for our API.

## Input Arguments
Provide a key as an argument that is given to you for free by signing up at the [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/).
